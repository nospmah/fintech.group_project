## **Research Questions to Answer**
---

**Should you buy bitcoin, historically?**<br><br/>
**Historical Analysis**
* Monte Carlo Simulation
    * S&P

**Should you buy bitcoin, RIGHT NOW?**
* Technical Analysis - On-Chain
* Technical Analysis - Market
<br><br/>



## **Foreward**
---
#### We started this project out with certain indicators in mind that are unique to bitcoin (on-chain analysis). We decided to run correlations on price vs some of these indicators, of which most returned insignificant correlation values (under .5). Instead of chasing after indicators that resulted in high correlation values, we chose to display them regardless. Our hypothesis based on what we knew about these indicators turned out to be false.
